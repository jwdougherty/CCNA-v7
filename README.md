# CCNA-v7

Certified Network Associate (CCNA) v7.0
Description
This course gives you a broad range of fundamental knowledge for all IT careers. Through a combination of lecture, hands-on labs, and self-study, you will learn
how to install, operate, configure, and verify basic IPv4 and IPv6 networks. The course covers configuring network components such as switches, routers, and
wireless LAN controllers; managing network devices; and identifying basic security threats. The course also gives you a foundation in network programmability,
automation, and software-defined networking.
This course helps you prepare to take the 200-301 Cisco® Certified Network Associate (CCNA®) exam. By passing this one exam, you earn CCNA certification.
The 200-301 CCNA exam goes live on February 24, 2020.
Objectives
The trainee will be able to:
• Learn the knowledge and skills to install, configure, and operate a small- to medium-sized network
• Gain a foundation in the essentials of networking, security, and automation
• Prepare for the 200-301 CCNA exam, which earns CCNA certification
Audience
This training is designed for anyone seeking CCNA certification. The course also provides foundational knowledge for all support technicians involved in the basic
installation, operation, and verification of Cisco networks.
The job roles best suited to the material in this course are:
• Entry-level network engineer
• Network administrator
• Network support technician
• Help desk technician


Course details
The course is comprised of three training parts as follows:


1. Introduction to Networks (ITN)
This part covers the architecture, structure, functions and components of the Internet and other computer networks. Students achieve a basic understanding of how
networks operate and how to build simple local area networks (LAN), perform basic configurations for routers and switches, and implement Internet Protocol (IP).
Students will be able to:
• Configure switches and end devices to provide access to local and remote network resources.
• Explain how physical and data link layer protocols support the operation of Ethernet in a switched network.
• Configure routers to enable end-to-end connectivity between remote devices.
• Create IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes and verify network connectivity between devices.
• Explain how the upper layers of the OSI model support network applications.
• Configure a small network with security best practices.
• Troubleshoot connectivity in a small network.


2. Switching, Routing, and Wireless Essentials (SRWE):
This part covers the architecture, components, and operations of routers and switches in small networks and introduces wireless local area networks (WLAN) and
security concepts. Students learn how to configure and troubleshoot routers and switches for advanced functionality using security best practices and resolve
common issues with protocols in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
Students will be able to:
• Configure VLANs and Inter-VLAN routing applying security best practices.
• Troubleshoot inter-VLAN routing on Layer 3 devices.
• Configure redundancy on a switched network using STP and EtherChannel.
• Troubleshoot EtherChannel on switched networks.
• Explain how to support available and reliable networks using dynamic addressing and first-hop redundancy protocols.
• Configure dynamic address allocation in IPv6 networks.
• Configure WLANs using a WLC and L2 security best practices.
• Configure switch security to mitigate LAN attacks.
• Configure IPv4 and IPv6 static routing on routers.


3. Enterprise Networking, Security, and Automation (ENSA):
This part describes the architecture, components, operations, and security to scale for large, complex networks, including wide area network (WAN) technologies.
The course emphasizes network security concepts and introduces network virtualization and automation. Students learn how to configure, troubleshoot, and secure
enterprise network devices and understand how application programming interfaces (API) and configuration management tools enable network automation.
Students will be able to:
• Configure single-area OSPFv2 in both point-to-point and multiaccess networks.
• Explain how to mitigate threats and enhance network security using access control lists and security best practices.
• Implement standard IPv4 ACLs to filter traffic and secure administrative access.
• Configure NAT services on the edge router to provide IPv4 address scalability.
• Explain techniques to provide address scalability and secure remote access for WANs.
• Explain how to optimize, monitor, and troubleshoot scalable network architectures.
• Explain how networking devices implement QoS.
• Implement protocols to manage the network.
• Explain how technologies such as virtualization, software defined networking, and automation affect evolving networks.
Prerequisites
Before taking this course, you should have:
• Basic computer literacy
• Basic PC operating system navigation skills
• Basic Internet usage skills
• Basic IP address knowledge
There are no formal prerequisites for CCNA certification, but you should make sure to have a good understanding of the exam topics.
