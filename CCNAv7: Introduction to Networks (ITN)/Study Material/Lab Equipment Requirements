CCNAv7: Introduction to Networks (ITN) Outline
The first course in the CCNA curriculum introduces the architectures, models, protocols, and networking elements that connect users,
devices, applications and data through the internet and across modern computer networks - including IP addressing and Ethernet
fundamentals. By the end of the course, students can build simple local area networks (LANs) that integrate IP addressing schemes,
foundational network security, and perform basic configurations for routers and switches.
